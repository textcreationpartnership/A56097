            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Protestant UNION or PRINCIPLES wherein <hi>English Protestants</hi> are Agreed.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE Learned Dr.</hi> Barrow, <hi>in a Sermon concerning the Unity of the Church, on</hi> Eph. <hi>4. saith,</hi> It is evident the Church is one by consent in Faith and Opinion concerning all Principal Matters of Doctrine, especially in those which have considerable influence upon the Practice of Piety, towards God, Righteousness towards Men, and Sobriety of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. <hi>Whereupon what the sweet temper'd</hi> Dean <hi>of</hi> Canterbury <hi>did in a Sermon propose to the serious Consideration of his Countrymen of</hi> Yorkshire, <hi>should be well-weighed by all English Protestants,</hi> viz. Ought not the great Matters wherein we are agreed, our Æ²nion in the Doctrines of the Christian Religion, and in all the necessary Articles of that Faith which was once deliver'd to the Saints, in the same Sacraments, and in all the substantial parts of Gods Worship, and in the Duties of Christian Life, to be of greater force to unite us; than difference in doubtful Opinions, and in little Rites and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of Worship to divide and break us? <hi>Dr.</hi> Warmestree, <hi>sometime Dean of</hi> Worcester, <hi>would have answer'd as he did in his</hi> Expedients for Peace <hi>(proposed to the Council of State, 1660.)</hi> All spiritual Tyranny should be laid aside, whereby Men take upon them to make their Judgments or Apprehensions, and too often their Passions and Interests, the Rule of other Mens Consciences: <hi>And again,</hi> That those things wherein we differ may be compos'd, by an Appeal to those things wherein we are Agreed. <hi>As 'tis plain the generality of English Protestants are in these ensuing</hi> Principles (<hi>saving that the</hi> Antipaedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists <hi>do not allow the 84th Proposition) Because the Dissenters generally receive them, and by the Parallels in the other Column they are assented to by those that Subscribe to the 39</hi> Articles <hi>and</hi> Books of Homilies. <hi>As they have past two Editions more at large than here, 1672, and 1675. in the Explanation of the</hi> Principles, <hi>by</hi> Thomas Adams, <hi>sometime Chaplain to the Countess Dowager of</hi> Clare. <hi>Indeed the most Learned and Pious Archbishop</hi> Æ²sher <hi>did certainly much value these</hi> Principles <hi>when first Publish'd, affirming to some Persons, of credit then,</hi> That they were to be had in esteem above any Compos'd by any Synod since the Apostles times. <hi>So that considering this Agreement, and that Subscription by the 13</hi> Eliz. <hi>c. 12. is required with a limitation,</hi> viz. To the Articles of Religion, which [only] concern the Confession of the true Christian Faith, and the Doctrine of the Sacraments. Concerning Rites and Ceremonies by Political Constitution among us; <hi>As Archbishop</hi> Sands <hi>said,</hi> some of them are not so Expedient for this Church <hi>Now,</hi> but that in the Church Reformed, and in all this time of the Gospel, wherein the seed of the Scripture hath so long been sown, they may be better disused, by little and little, than more and more urged. <hi>Dr.</hi> Carlton <hi>sometime Bishop of</hi> Chichester, <hi>in his Examination of the</hi> Appeal <hi>saith,</hi> p. <hi>217. Printed 1626.</hi> Tho' the Church of <hi>England</hi> be the best Reformed Church, yet it is not the only Reformed Church: and it might seem no good Providence in us, to stand so by our selves, as to reject and disdain the consent of other Churches, tho' they do not agree with us in Discipline.âThe Dissonance in Ceremonies, need not break the Consonance in Faith with those Churches, if we seek the Peace of the Churches that profess the same Doctrine. <hi>Sith it is asserted in the 34th Article of Religion of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>1562.</hi> It is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one, or utterly like; for at all times they have been divers, and may be changed, according to the diversity of Countries, Times, and mens Manners, so that nothing be ordain'd against Gods Word. <hi>Wherefore Bishop</hi> Jewel <hi>in a Sermon of his to the University of</hi> Oxford, <hi>saith,</hi> If all the Worship of God, all Godliness, all Religion, be to be sought out of the Word of God: If the Institutions of Men have miserably perverted all things in all times; Let us, my Brethren, to whom the Office of Teaching is allotted, consider how dangerous a thing it is to speak more. <hi>These Principles wherein English Protestants agree, as founded upon, and agreeable to that Word, if not only received, but conscientiously practised, will be as a notable Preservation against Popery, so if not clogg'd with the imposition of Disputables, a good Defensative of U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ity at this time amongst English Protestants. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Seven Bishops did profess in a Paper presented to the late King,</hi> They do not want tenderness to Dissenters: in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to whom they should be willing, to come to such a temper as should be thought fit, when Matters comes to be setledâ<hi>Some of them afterwards advising the same King amongst things absolutely necessary to a Settlement, That</hi> He would suffer a free Parliament to redress Grievances, to settle Matters in Church and State upon just and solid Foundations, and Establish a due Liberty of Conscience. <hi>But, saith Bishop</hi> Jer. Taylor, (<hi>in his Cases of Conscience,</hi> l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi> R. <hi>20. Sect. 3.</hi>) When the Church doth any thing beyond her Commission, she doth no way oblige the Conscience, neither Actively, nor Passively.</p>

                        <p n="6">6. There are three Persons in the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one God, the same in substance, equal in power and glory.</p>

                           <pb n="2" facs="tcp:66162:2"/>9. The work of Creation, is Gods making all things, of nothing, by the word of his power, in the space of fix days, and all very good.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. God created man, male and female, after his own Image, in knowledg, righteousness, and holiness, with dominion over the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Gods works of Providence, are his most holy, wise, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preserving, and governing all his creatures, and all their actions.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. When God had created man, he entred into a Covenant of life with him, upon condition of perfect obedience, forbidding him to eat of the tree of the knowledg of good and evil, upon pain of death.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Our first Parents being left to the freedom of their own will, fell from the state wherein they were created, by sinning against God.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Sin is any want of conformity unto, or transgression of the Law of God.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. The sin whereby our first Parents fell from the estate wherein they were created, was their eating the forbidden fruit.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. The Covenant being made with <hi>Adam</hi> not only for himself, but for his Posterity; all Mankind, descending from him by ordinary ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, sinned in him, and fell with him in his first transgression.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. The fall brought mankind into an estate of sin and misery.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. The sinfulness of that estate whereunto man fell, consists in the guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s first sin, the want of original righteousness, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his whole nature, which is commonly called Original sin, together with all actual transgressions which proceed from it.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. All mankind by their fall, lost communion with God, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his wrath and curse, and so made liable to all miseries in this life, to death it self, and to the pains of hell for ever.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. God having out of his meer good pleasure, from all eternity, elected some to everlasting life, did enter into a Covenant of Grace, to deliver them out of the estate of sin and misery, and to bring them into an estate of salvation by a Redeemer.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. The only Redeemer of Gods Elect is the Lord Jesus Christ, who being the eternal Son of God, became man, and so was, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth to be God and man, in two distinct natures, and one person, for ever.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. Christ the Son of God became man, by taking to himself a true body, and a reasonable soul, being conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and born of her, yet without sin.</p>
                        <p n="23">23. Christ as our Redeemer, executeth the Offices of a Prophet, of a Priest, and of a King, both in his Estate of Humiliation and Exaltation.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. Christ executeth the Office of a Prophet, in revealing to us, by his Word, and Spirit, the Will of God for our Salvation.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. Christ executeth the Office of a Priest, in his once offering up of himself a Sacrifice to satisfie Divine Justice, and to reconcile us to God; and in making continual intercession for us.</p>
                        <p n="26">26. Christ executeth the Office of a King, in subduing us to himself, in ruling and defending us, and in restraining and conquering all his and our Enemies.</p>
                        <p n="27">27. Christs Humiliation consisted in his being born, and that in a low condition, made under the Law, undergoing the miseries of this life, the wrath of God, and the cursed death of the Cross, in being buried, and continuing under the power of death for a time.</p>
                        <p n="28">28. Christs Exaltation consisteth in his rising again from the dead on the third day, in ascending up into Heaven, and sitting at the right hand of God the Father, and in coming to judg the world at the last day.</p>
                        <p n="29">29. We are made partakers of the Redemption purchased by Christ, by the effectual application of it to us, by his holy Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="30">30. The Spirit applieth to us the Redemption purchased by Christ, by working faith in us, and thereby uniting us to Christ in our Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Calling.</p>
                        <p n="31">31. Effectual Calling is the work of Gods Spirit, whereby convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing us of our sin and misery, enlightning our minds in the knowledg

                        <p n="32">32. They that are Effectually called, do in this life partake of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Adoption, Sanctification, and the several benefits which in this life do either accompany, or flow from them.</p>
                        <p n="33">33. Justification is an act of Gods free-grace, wherein he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth all our sins, and accepteth us as righteous in his sight, only for the righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and received by faith alone.</p>

                        <p n="40">40. The Rule which God at first revealed to man for his obedience, was the Moral Law.</p>
                        <p n="41">41. The Moral Law is summarily comprehended in the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
                        <p n="42">42. The sum of the Ten Commandments, is to love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our soul, with all our strength, and with all our mind, and our neighbour as our selves.</p>
                        <p n="43">43. The Preface and Ten Commandments are in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2.</p>
                        <p n="44">44. The Preface to the Ten Commandments teacheth us, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God is the Lord, and our God and Redeemer, therefore we are bound to keep all his Commandments.</p>
                        <p n="45">45. The first Commandment requireth us to know, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg God to be the only true God, and our God, and to worship and glorifie him accordingly.</p>
                        <p n="46">46. The first Commandment forbiddeth the denying, or not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping and glorifying the true God as God, and our God, and the giving that worship and glory to any other which is due to him alone.</p>
                        <p n="47">47. These words <hi>[before me]</hi> in the first Commandment teach us, that God who seeth all things, taketh notice of, and is much displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the sin of having any other God.</p>
                        <p n="48">48. The second Commandment requireth the receiving, observing, and keeping pure and entire all such religious Worship and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as God hath appointed in his Word.</p>
                        <p n="49">49. The second Commandment forbiddeth the worshipping of God by Images, or any other way not appointed in his Word.</p>
                        <p n="50">50. The Reasons annexed to the second Commandment, are Gods Soveraignty over us, his propriety in us, and the zeal he hath to his own Worship.</p>
                        <p n="51">51. The third Commandment requireth the holy and reverent use of Gods Names, Titles, Attributes, Ordinances, Word, and Works.</p>
                        <p n="52">
                           <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66162:3"/>52. The third Commandment forbiddeth all prophaning, or abusing of any thing whereby God maketh himself known.</p>
                        <p n="53">53. The reason annexed to the third Commandment is, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the breakers of this Commandment may escape punishment from men, yet the Lord our God will not suffer them to escape his righteous judgment.</p>
                        <p n="54">54. The fourth Commandment requireth the keeping holy to God such set-times as he hath appointed in his Word, expresly one whole day in seven, to be a holy Sabbath unto himself.</p>
                        <p n="55">55. From the beginning of the World to the Resurrection of Christ, God appointed the seventh day of the week to be the weekly Sabbath, and the first day of the week ever since to continue to the end of the World, which is the Christian Sabbath.</p>
                        <p n="56">56. the Sabbath is to be sanctified by an holy resting all that day, even from such worldly employments and recreations as are lawful on other days, and spending the whole time in publick and private exercises of Gods Worship, except so much as is to be taken up in the works of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity and mercy.</p>
                        <p n="57">57. The fourth Commandment forbiddeth the omission or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less performance of the Duties required and the profaning the day by Idleness, or doing that which is in it self sinful, or by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary thoughts, words, or works, about worldly employments or recreations.</p>
                        <p n="58">58. The Reasons annexed to the fourth Commandment are, Gods allowing us six days of the week for our own employments, his chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging special propriety in the seventh, his own example, and his blessing the Sabbath-day.</p>
                        <p n="59">59. The fifth Commandment requireth the preserving the honour, and performing the duties belonging to every one in their several places and relations, as Superiors, Inferiors, or Equals.</p>
                        <p n="60">60. The fifth Commandment forbiddeth the neglecting, or doing any thing against the honour and duty which belongeth to every one in their several places and relations.</p>
                        <p n="61">61. The Reason annexed to the fifth Commandment is, a promise of long life and prosperity (as far as it shall serve for Gods glory, and their own good) to all such as keep this Commandment.</p>
                        <p n="62">62. The sixth Commandment requireth all lawful endeavours to preserve our own life, and the life of others.</p>

                        <p n="64">64. The seventh Commandment requireth the preservation of our own, and our neighbours chastity, in heart, speech, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>
                        <p n="65">65. The seventh Commandment forbiddeth all unchast thoughts, words, and actions.</p>
                        <p n="66">66. The eighth Commandment requireth the lawful procuring and furthering the wealth and outward estate of our selves, and others.</p>
                        <p n="67">67. The eighth Commandment forbiddeth whatsoever doth, or may unjustly hinder our own, or our neighbours wealth, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward estate.</p>
                        <p n="68">68. The ninth Commandment requireth the maintaining and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of truth between man and man, and of our own, and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours good name, especially in witness-bearing.</p>
                        <p n="69">69 The ninth Commandment forbiddeth whatsoever is prejudicial to truth, or injurious to our own, or our neighbours good name.</p>
                        <p n="70">70. The tenth Commandment requireth full contentment with our own condition, with a right and charitable frame of spirit towards our neighbour, and all that is his.</p>
                        <p n="71">71. The tenth Commandment forbiddeth all discontentment with our own estate, envying or grieving at the good of our neighbour, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="73">73. Some sins in themselves, and by reason of several aggravations, are more hainous in the sight of God, than others.</p>
                        <p n="74">74. Every sin deserveth Gods wrath and curse, both in this life, and that which is to come.</p>
                        <p n="75">75. To escape the wrath and curse of God due to us for sin, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us Faith in Jesus Christ, repentance unto life, with the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent use of all outward means, whereby Christ communicateth to us the benefits of Redemption.</p>
                        <p n="76">76. Faith in Jesus Christ is a saving grace, whereby we receive, and rest upon him alone for salvation, as he is offered to us in the Gospel.</p>
                        <p n="77">77. Repentance unto life is a saving grace, whereby a Sinner out of the true sense of his sin, and apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ, doth with grief and hatred of his sin turn from it unto God, with full purpose of, and endeavours after new obedience.</p>
                        <p n="78">78. The outward and ordinary means whereby Christ communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to us the benefits of Redemption, are his Ordinances, especially the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer, all which are made effectual to the Elect for salvation.</p>
                        <p n="79">79. The Spirit of God maketh the reading, but especially the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, an effectual means of convincing and converting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and of building them up in holiness and comfort, through faith unto salvation.</p>
                        <p n="80">80. That the Word may become effectual to salvation, we must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thereunto with diligence, pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="81">81. The Sacraments become effectual means of salvation, not from any virtue in them, or in him that doth administer them, but only by the blessing of Christ, and the working of his Spirit in them that by Faith receive them.</p>
                        <p n="82">82. A Sacrament is an holy Ordinance, instituted of Christ, wherein by sensible signs, Christ and the benefits of the New Covenant are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, sealed, and applied to Believers.</p>
                        <p n="83">83. The Sacraments of the new Testament are Baptism, and the Lords Supper.</p>
                        <p n="84">84. Baptism is a Sacrament, wherein the washing with water in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and seal our ingrafting into Christ, and partaking of the benefits of the Covenant of Grace, and our engagement to be the Lords.</p>
                        <p n="85">85. Baptism is not to be administred to any out of the visible Church, till they profess their faith in Christ, and obedience to him, but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of such as are members of the visible Church are to be baptized.</p>
                        <p n="86">86. The Lords Supper is a Sacrament, wherein by giving and receiving Bread and Wine, according to Gods appointment, his death is shewed forth, and the worthy receivers are not after a corporal and carnal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but by faith made partakers of his body and blood, with all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, to their spiritual nourishment and growth in grace.</p>
                        <p n="87">87. It is required of them that would worthily partake of the Lords Supper, that they examine themselves of their knowledg to discern the Lords body, of their faith to feed upon him, of their repentance, love, and new obedience, lest coming unworthily, they eat and drink judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to themselves.</p>
                        <p n="88">88. Prayer is an offering up of our desires to God, for things agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his will, in the name of Christ, with confession of our sins, and thankful acknowledgment of his mercies.</p>
                        <p n="89">
                           <pb n="6" facs="tcp:66162:4"/>89. The whole Word of God is of use to direct us in Prayer, but the special Rule of Direction, is that Form of Prayer, which Christ taught his Disciples, commonly called the Lords Prayer.</p>
                        <p n="90">90. The Preface of the Lords Prayer, which is, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven;</hi> teacheth us, to draw near to God with all holy reverence, and confidence, as children to a Father, able and ready to help, and that we should pray with, and for others.</p>
                        <p n="91">91. In the first Petition, which is, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name;</hi> We pray, that God would enable us and others to glorifie him in all that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he makes himself known, and that he would dispose all things to his own glory.</p>
                        <p n="92">92. In the second Petition, which is, <hi>Thy Kingdom come;</hi> We pray, that Satans Kingdom may be destroyed, that the Kingdom of Grace may be advanced, our selves and others brought into it, and kept in it, and that the Kingdom of Glory may be hastened.</p>
                        <p n="93">93. In the third Petition, which is, <hi>Thy will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven;</hi> We pray, that God by his grace would make us able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to know, obey, and submit to his will in all things, as the Angels do in Heaven.</p>
                        <p n="94">94. In the fourth Petition, which is, <hi>Give us this day our daily Bread;</hi> We pray, that of Gods free gift we may receive a competent portion of the good things of this life, and enjoy his blessings with them.</p>
                        <p n="95">95. In the fifth Petition, which is, <hi>And forgive us our debts, as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our debtors;</hi> We pray, that God for Christs sake would freely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all our sins, which we are the rather encouraged to ask, because by his grace we are enabled from the heart to forgive others.</p>
                        <p n="96">96. In the sixth Petition, which is, <hi>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil;</hi> We pray, that God would either keep us from being tempted to sin, or support and deliver us when we are tempted.</p>
                        <p n="97">97. The Conclusion of the Lords Prayer, which is, <hi>For thine is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Power, and the Glory, for ever,</hi> Amen; teacheth us, to take our encouragement in prayer from God only, and in our Prayers to praise him, ascribing Kingdom, power, and glory to him, and in testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our desire and assurance to be heard, we say, <hi>Amen.</hi>

This Conjunction in my Service will tend to the better Æ²niting you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst your selves, and the Strengthening you against your Common Adversaries. <hi>And now they are about a Bill of Ease or Indulgence to the tender Consciences of Protestant Dissenters, from the Establishment in lesser Matters, considering what the present</hi> Lord Bishop of Salisbury <hi>hath Learnedly in several of his Books written unanswerably against Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and having in one Sermon truly given it as the</hi> Character and Glory of this Nation, that Tenderness and Compassion are natural to it; <hi>and what he hath rightly observ'd in another of Thanksgiving from</hi> Psal. <hi>144.15.</hi> p. <hi>220.</hi> The exact Conduct of Publick Justice; and the avoiding every Invasion upon the freedom of Conscience, which is the first and most sacred of all a mans rights, are the surest ways to prevent all just cause of complaint; to speak the truth, and to work righteousness, and relieve the Oppressed without respect of Persons, to plead the cause of the Widow and the Fatherless, and the not ruling over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of any with force or cruelty, but the leaving Men within the limits of a just discretion, as to the manner of it, the entire freedom of serving God in the sincerity of their Hearts, will put an end to many heavy and just complaints, which have been pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out before God in the bitterness of many mens Spirits; whose lives have been made a burden to them, only because they could not act contrary to those perswasions, which they were not able to change or overcome. <hi>As also what was written by a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prebend of that same Cathedral of</hi> Sarum, <hi>about six or seven years ago, to his (then) great hazard in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Reconciler, humbly pleading for condescention to his Dissenting Brethren, in things indifferent, for the sake of Peace; and shewing how unreasonable it is to make such things necessary conditions of Communion: which most Christian and generous undertaking, did afterwards in those evil days expose him to the lash of some of his high-flown imposing Brethren, who considered not (unless backward) the great service he had before done, in laying open the</hi> Idolatry of the Papists. <hi>Tho' in his Preface he urged the determination of</hi> King <hi>James</hi> the First; <hi>viz.</hi> âFor Concord there is no nearer way, than diligently to separate things necessary from the unnecessary, and to bestow all our labour that we may agree in the things necessary, and that in things unnecessary there may be Christian Liberty allow'd: Now His Majesty calls those things simply necessary which the Word of God expresly commandeth to be believed or done, or which the Ancient Church did gather from the Word of God by necessary consequence: But those things which by the Constitution of Men, without the Word of God, were for a time received into the Church of God, tho' piously and prudently introduc'd, His Majesty conceives they may be Changed, Mollified, Antiquated. <hi>And of King</hi> Charles <hi>the First, with Advice of his Privy Council, 1641.</hi> As for differences among our selves, for matters indifferent in their own nature, concerning Religion, we shall in tenderness to any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our Loving Subjects, very willingly comply with the Advice of our Parliament, that some Law may be made for the exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of tender Consciences from punishment, or Prosecution for such Ceremonies, and in such cases, which by the judgment of most men are held to be matters indifferent, and of some to be absolutely unlawful. <hi>And of King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second in his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from</hi> Breda, <hi>April 4. 1660.</hi>âWe do declare a Liberty to tender Consciences, and that no Man shall be disquieted or called in question for differences of Opinion, <hi>which do not disturb the peace of the Kingdom;</hi> and that we shall be ready to consent to such an Act of Parliament, as upon mature deliberation shall be offered to us, for the full granting that Indulgence.

               <hi>And in his Declaration concerning Ecclesiastical Affairs,</hi> Octob. <hi>25. 1660.</hi> We do not think that reverence we have for the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the least degree diminished by our condescention, not peremptorily to insist upon some particulars of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which however introduc'd by the Piety and Devotion, and Order of former times, may not be so agreeable to the present, but may even lessen that Piety and Devotion, for the improvement whereof they might happily be first introduced, and consequently may well be dispensed with, <hi>&amp;c.

If <hi>Crossing, Kneeling, Surplice,</hi> be needful to be used in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> why not <hi>in all the Churches of the Saints?</hi> If they are needful or expedient for Order, <hi>Uniformity,</hi> for reverence and decency in this Age, why not in that in which our Lord and his <hi>Apostles</hi> lived, and through all subsequent Ages of the Church? If therefore Christ did neither by <hi>himself,</hi> nor his <hi>Apostles,</hi> who formed the <hi>First Churches,</hi> and delivered us his mind by the <hi>Spirit, institute</hi> and impose these <hi>Rites,</hi> then either the imposing them is needless, or else you must say that Christ hath omitted what was needful to the due performance of his worship, which seemeth to imply, that either he was ignorant of what to do, or careless and neglective of his own Affairs; which cannot be asserted without Blasphemy. <hi>Thus far he urged Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>who hath heartily laboured heretofore more abundantly than us all for the Union of Protestants, and doth still labour, as may be seen by the warmth of his Fifty Serious Questions in the close of his new Book now published, Entituled, The English-Nonconformity, as under King</hi> Charles <hi>II. and King</hi> James <hi>II. truely Stated and Argued by him, who (in the Title page) earnestly beseecheth Rulers, and Clergy, not to Divide, and Destroy the Land, and cast their own Souls on the dreadful Guilt and Punishment of National Perjury, Lying, deliberate Covenanting to Sin against God, corrupt his Church, and not Amend, nor by Laws or blind Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, to reproach faithful Ministers of Christ, and Judge them to Scorn and Beggery, and to Lie and Die in Jails as Rogues, and so to strengthen Profaneness, Popery and Schism, and all for want of willingness and patience to Read and Hear their just Defence; while they can spend much more time in Sin and Vanity. The Author humbly begs that he and his Books of unconfutable Defence of a Mistaken persecuted Cause may not be Witnesses against them for such great and wilful Sin to their Condemnation. To which purpose this holy Man, and his Brethren in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission with him, above twenty seven years ago, did speak and write in</hi> a Petition for Peace, <hi>to the most Reverend Arch-bishops and Bishops, and the Reverend their Assistants Commission'd by his (then) Majesty, to treat about the Alteration of the Book of Common-prayer, wherein they humbly Petition them in the same Commission,</hi> on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of these yet troubled and unhealed Churches, and of many thousand Souls that are dear to Christ, on whose behalf <hi>say they there,</hi> we are press'd in Spirit, in the sense of duty, most earnestly to beseech you, as you tender the peace and prosperity of these Churches, the comfort of His Majesty in the Æ²nion of his Subjects, and the peace of your Souls in the great day of your Accounts, that, laying by all former and present exasperating and alienating differences, you will not now deny us your consent and assistance to those means that shall be prov'd honest and cheap, and needful to those great desirable ends, for which we all profess to have our Offices and Lives. <hi>They pathetically plead there, amongst many other cogent Motives.</hi> We beseech you consider, when you should promote the joy and thankfulness of his <hi>(then)</hi> Majesties Subjects for his happy Restauration, <hi>(and is there not the same reason now for the signal advancement of His present Majesty to the Throne, upon His Declaration for Civil and Sacred Liberties?)</hi> Whether it be equal and seasonable to bring upon so many of themâcalamities in depriving them of the liberty of publick worship, far greater than the meer loss of all their worldly sustenance can amount to: In a day of common joy to bring this causlesly on so many of His Majesties Subjects, and to force them to lye down in Heart-breaking sorrows, as being almost as far undone, as man can do it; this is not a due requital of the Lord for so great deliverances: Especially considering that if it were never so certain, that it is the sin of the Ministers that dare not be Re-ordained or Conform; it's hard that so many thousand of innocent People should suffer even in their Souls for the fault of others.âAnd if we thought it would not be misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, we would here remember you, how great and considerable a part of the Three Nations they are, that must either incur these sufferings, or condole them that undergo them, and how great a grief it will be to His Majesty to see his grieved Subjects, and how great a joy it will be to him, to have their Liberty, Thanks and Prayers, and to see them live in Prosperity, Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort under his happy Government. And we may plead the nature of their cause, to move you to compassionate your afflicted Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in their Sufferings. It is in your own account, but for refusing Conformity to things indifferent, or, at the most, of no necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Salvation. And we crave leave to represent to you the great disproportion in necessity and worth, between the things in Question, and the Salvation of so many, as may be obtain'd by a free and faithful exercise of the Ministry of those that now are, and that are yet like to be laid aside; do you think the Lord that died for Souls, and hath sent us to learn what meaneth <hi>[I will have mercy and not sacrifice,</hi> Mat. <hi>9.13.]</hi> is better pleas'd with Re-ordination, Subscription and Ceremonies, than with the saving of Souls, and the means of his own appointment? âHow comes it to pass that Æ²nity, Concord, and Order, must be placed in those things which are no way necessary thereto? Will there not be Order and Concord in holy Obedience, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Worshipping of God, on the terms which we now propose and crave, without the aforesaid matter of offence? âWe humbly crave we may not in this be more rigorously dealt with, than the Pastors and People of the Primitive Church were: âWe humbly crave leave to oer it to your consideration, what judgment all the Protestant Churches are likely to pass on your Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and how your cause and ours will stand represented to them and all succeeding Ages. âAnd you know if we are not in point of Ceremonies or Forms, in every thing, of your mind; it is no more strange to have variety of Intellectual Apprehensions in the same Kingdom and Church, than variety of Temperatures, and degrees of Age and Strength. âWe beseech you also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that Men have not their Æ²nderstandings at their command; much less can they be commanded by others: If they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so willing to believe all that is imposed on them to be lawful, they cannot therefore believe it, because they would, the Intellect being not free. âNothing more affecteth us, than to think of the lamentable Divisions that have been caused, and are still like to be, whiles things unnecessary are so imposed: And on the contrary, how blessed an Æ²nity and Peace we might enjoy, if these occasions of Division were removed, and we might but have leave to serve God as his Apostles did. <hi>Very much more (which it would be tedious to bring into this Paper) may be seen in that most affectionate</hi> Petition for Peace.</p>
